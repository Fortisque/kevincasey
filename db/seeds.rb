            a team of 6 and were connected to our client BAMRU (Bay Area Mountain Rescue Unit) through our CS169 class at Berkeley. Our client
            wanted secure photos in order to share potentially crime sensitive information to each other during a rescure operation. Over the 
            course of 4 iterations we developed various features including cropping, rotation and uploading photos to Flickr and Facebook.

            The first part was a search problem, agents could not be killed, so the problem was a matter steps required to collect pellets.
            I used brute force randomized improvement with a backing of MST and clusting.  For the 3rd and 4th part we used a smart reflex agent
            and as a lookahead used a precomputed 'trap table' solved through dynamic programming to determine whether or not a 
            ghost could kill a pacman agent one on one in a given situation.  We managed to get first place in all but the 2nd release!"

            multi-threading to get up to 70 GFlops.  The most interesting thing was that we realized a lot of the hard work was done computing edge cases (literally
            the edge of the matrix multiplication) because padding the matricies takes too much time and reusing the cache is much more difficult "

            useful and intuitive to be able to see the result as a familar figure such as sqrt(5).  I used a brute force

            The idea was that when you turn off your car to park it the bluetooth connection is dropped, thus your phone
            can automatically track where you stopped.  I managed to make it work for a faked bluetooth connection coming from
            my iPad, but I never really stablized it for use with actual cars (there was a lot of problems with the app backgrounding
            and finding singnals). So unfortunately the app was left in an unfinished state (and will likely remain that way)"
