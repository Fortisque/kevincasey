            wanted secure photos in order to share potentially crime sensitive information to each other during a rescure operation. Over the 
            course of 4 iterations we developed various features including cropping, rotation and uploading photos to Flickr and Facebook.

            I used brute force randomized improvement with a backing of MST and clusting.  For the 3rd and 4th part we used a smart reflex agent
            and as a lookahead used a precomputed 'trap table' solved through dynamic programming to determine whether or not a

            the edge of the matrix multiplication) because padding the matricies takes too much time and reusing the cache is much more difficult "

            attend meals on our site and we track how many times an ingredient is used so we can accurately gauge how
            much of the ingredient was used at each meal so we know the cost of the meal.  With a custom calendar to signup

            caclulator for this it would always give you back the solution in the form of decimal values, but it was obviously more
            useful and intuitive to be able to see the result as a familar figure such as sqrt(5).  I used a brute force

            The idea was that when you turn off your car to park it the bluetooth connection is dropped, thus your phone
            can automatically track where you stopped.  I managed to make it work for a faked bluetooth connection coming from
            my iPad, but I never really stablized it for use with actual cars (there was a lot of problems with the app backgrounding
            and finding singnals). So unfortunately the app was left in an unfinished state (and will likely remain that way)"
