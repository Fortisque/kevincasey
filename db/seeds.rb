            researchers exploring the Free Speech Movement Archive.  We were a team of 3 programmers (myself included) and one humanist.
            One of the programmers and our humanist managed give us brilliant ideas for design and feature requests.  I mainly worked on

      description: 'This was a rails app, and I was the only one that knew rails beforehand so I handeled the controller and backend logic.
            Luckily my 3 other teammates were able to build and design a beautiful front-end on top of my database.  We added various features from just
            a basic database time logging including a dashboard that can log current tasks and a calendar view.'

              some of the frontend for this."

      description: "This was my first experience building a web app, so it was exciting because none of us knew what we were doing. We were 
            a team of 6 and were connected to our client BAMRU (Bay Area Mountain Rescue Unit) through our CS169 class at Berkeley. Our client
            wanted secure photos in order to share potentially crime sensitive information to each other during a rescure operation. Over the 
            course of 4 iterations we developed various features including cropping, rotation and uploading photos to Flickr and Facebook.
            We used TDD and Agile, and during the project I worked all over the stack to make sure everything worked."

            The first part was a search problem, agents could not be killed, so the problem was a matter steps required to collect pellets.

      description: "Used concepts of intermediate board evaluation, hash mapping, and depth 5 alpha-beta pruning to win a
            bracket based tournament in a class of 500.  My board evaluation was critical, and made sure to only favor positions
            closer to winning.  I saw the game as a simplified game of chess and was able to program a very strong player."

            caclulator for this it would always give you back the solution in the form of decimal values, but it was obviously more
            useful and intuitive to be able to see the result as a familar figure such as sqrt(5).  I used a brute force
            solution to solve the problem which clearly is not the most elegent solution but it worked for what I intended."

      description: "My friend actually gave me the idea for this because he kept forgetting where he parked his car.
            The idea was that when you turn off your car to park it the bluetooth connection is dropped, thus your phone
            can automatically track where you stopped.  I managed to make it work for a faked bluetooth connection coming from
            my iPad, but I never really stablized it for use with actual cars (there was a lot of problems with the app backgrounding
            and finding singnals). So unfortunately the app was left in an unfinished state (and will likely remain that way)"
