    This site was built using Ruby on Rails and (as you can probably tell) is currently hosted on heroku and
    the code backing this is located on <a href="https://github.com/Fortisque/kevincasey">GitHub</a>.  I know that using Rails
    is somewhat overkill for hosting what is basically a static site, but I really love developing in Rails!
