    <h4>GoDaddy</h4>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2014 I worked as a Software Development Intern at GoDaddy.  I worked on
      the Online Store product, which is designed to allow nontechnical people to construct a
      quick shopping cart.  Online Store is built off and contributes back to
      <a href="http://www.github.com/spree/spree">spree.</a> I tackled a variety of bugs 
      and worked on features such as internationalization, internal analytics and allowing 
      merchants to have custom code in their sites.  We also created a spree extension called <a href="http://www.github.com/godaddy/spree_plugins">SpreePlugins</a> that allows mechants to easily insert scripts onto their products page, such as share buttons or comment threads.

    <h4>Facebook Open Academy</h4>
    <p>
      After taking CS169 the professor Armando Fox invited me to attend Facebook's Open Academy,
      so over the Spring of 2014 I directly worked with part of the Rails Core Team mentors (such as <a href="https://github.com/tenderlove">Aaron</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matthewd"> Matthew</a>) and students from other universities to contribute to <a href="http://www.github.com/rails/rails">Rails.</a>

      I'm currently the one and only grader for the CS169 (Software Engineering) class. I grade work from the students that can
      come in either as Rails, Django or Node.js. We use google in order to share information among the
      teaching staff and I wrote a lot of scripts using Google Apps Scripts (similar to javascript) in
      order to assign stable teams, facilitate anonymous team evaluation and autograde. We use google spreadsheets as our
      database, scripts as our controller and forms for our views, creating an infrastructure like that of a
      light website.

      I was a lab assistant for both CS61C and CS61A, two of the undergrad CS classes.  I helped explain various concepts to
      students through lab exercises and office hours. I graded labs and verified understanding and completeness.
